# ranstdlib
My own implementation of a standard library

Most of the headers will be available as separate modules

## How to use
Include ranstdlib.h in your project;
```C
#include "ranstdlib.h"
#include "ranstdlib/ranstdlib.h"
#include <ranstdlib.h>
#include <ranstdlib/ranstdlib.h>
```
using one of the above.

For all functions to be declared put;
```C
#define RANSTDLIB_IMPLEMENTATION
```
above the include statement.

## Contribute
Feel free to make contributions! Try to fit in with the current code base which may change.

## TODO (in no particular order)
- add other basic stuff (might just be overlays of the actual stdlib)
